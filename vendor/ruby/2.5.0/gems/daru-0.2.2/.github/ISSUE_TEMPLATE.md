Heya! We are glad you are going to contribute to Daru by creating an issue, and kindly ask you to
follow the simple rules:

1. If it is a bug report, please provide a **self-containing** Ruby code for reproducing the bug.
  This means if Daru contributors just copy-paste the code from issue into `this-is-bug.rb` and run
  `ruby this-is-bug.rb`, it will be reproduced. If the bug is hard to spot (e.g. it is not some
  `NoMethodError`, but the differences in data structure), please show it with comment in code or
  plain text in the issue.
2. If it is a feature request, try to do the following (if possible):
  * show how new feature will work with small code example;
  * explain the use case (if it is not 200% obvious);
  * if you are aware of it, show how it works in pandas and/or R.
3. If it is just a question ("how to do this or that" or "why Daru does this or that") feel free to
  write it in any form that is convenient to you, but remember code examples and use cases are always
  welcome.

Thanks! And please remove this text when finished with your issue description :)
